# Using td-harness with Cursor

## Setup

### Option 1: Rules Directory (Recommended)

Cursor supports a `.cursor/rules/` directory for project-specific rules:

```bash
# Create the rules directory
mkdir -p .cursor/rules

# Copy skills you want as rules
cp /path/to/td-harness/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/test-driven-development.md
cp /path/to/td-harness/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/code-review-and-quality.md
cp /path/to/td-harness/skills/context-engineering/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/context-engineering.md
```

Rules in this directory are automatically loaded into Cursor's context.

### Option 2: .cursorrules File

Create a `.cursorrules` file in your project root with the essential skills inlined:

```bash
# Generate a combined rules file
cat /path/to/td-harness/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md > .cursorrules
echo "\n---\n" >> .cursorrules
cat /path/to/td-harness/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md >> .cursorrules
```

### Option 3: Notepads

Cursor's Notepads feature lets you store reusable context. Create a notepad for each skill you use frequently:

1. Open Cursor → Settings → Notepads
2. Create a new notepad named "swe: Test-Driven Development"
3. Paste the content of `skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`
4. Reference it in chat with `@notepad swe: Test-Driven Development`

## Recommended Configuration

### Essential Skills (Always Load)

Add these to `.cursor/rules/`:

1. `test-driven-development.md` — TDD workflow and Prove-It pattern
2. `code-review-and-quality.md` — Five-axis review
3. `context-engineering.md` — Keep prompts focused with the right context

### Phase-Specific Skills (Load as Notepads)

Create notepads for skills you use contextually:

- "swe: API Design" → `api-and-interface-design/SKILL.md`
- "swe: Frontend UI" → `frontend-ui-engineering/SKILL.md`
- "swe: Security" → `security-and-hardening/SKILL.md`
- "swe: Performance" → `performance-optimization/SKILL.md`

Reference them with `@notepad` when working on relevant tasks.

## Usage Tips

1. **Don't load all skills at once** — Cursor has context limits. Load 2-3 skills as rules and keep others as notepads.
2. **Reference skills explicitly** — Tell Cursor "Follow the test-driven-development rules for this change" to ensure it reads the loaded rules.
3. **Use agents for review** — Copy `agents/code-reviewer.md` content and tell Cursor to "review this diff using this code review framework."
4. **Load references on demand** — When working on performance, reference `@notepad performance-checklist` or paste the checklist content.
